            <p>The Center for Women in Technology (CWIT), was established at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) in July 1998, 
                dedicated to providing global leadership in achieving women’s full participation in all aspects of information technology (IT).
                In 2006, the the scope of CWIT’s influence at UMBC expanded to include Engineering majors as well. In July 2011, the name change 
                from The Center for Women and Information Technology captured the twin threads at the center of CWIT – women and technology – 
                while being broader about the types of technology included. Women’s participation in the creation of technology in computing and 
                engineering fields will strengthen the workforce, raise the standard of living for many women, and help to assure that technology 
                addresses women’s needs and expands the possibilities for their lives.

                CWIT’s Relationship to UMBC:
                
                CWIT supports UMBC’s commitment to diversity at all levels and its efforts to create a campus community rich in intellectual, cultural,
                and ethnic diversity.  CWIT helps the University achieve its regional and national mission by identifying those areas in science, technology, 
                and engineering where women are significantly underrepresented, attracting well-qualified female students to UMBC through special scholarship 
                initiatives such as the CWIT Scholars Program, and working with departments and other campus partners to help make UMBC a welcoming place for women
                in engineering and information technology.  CWIT also supports the University in its efforts to attract private and public funding to achieve its 
                mission.
