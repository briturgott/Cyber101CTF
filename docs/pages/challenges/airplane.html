			The UMBC Cyber Dawgs are set to compete at a national cybersecurity competition 
			this week. Unfortunately, it seems like the competition will be much harder this year. 
			When the team asked where the competition would be held, they received a strange map 
			with no identifying features. Can you help? The flag today consists of the name of 
			the lake closest to the building this map was drawn of.
