			A  very important super secret artifact was stolen from the CWIT office. 
			A secret agent was sent to retrieve it but was captured before she could 
			grab the artifact and return. Luckily she was able to send us a text message 
			containing only this image. Hopefully our Cyber101 team will be able to find 
			the map to the artifactâ€™s location.
